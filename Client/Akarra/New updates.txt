-New NPC Chippy added in Swamp knight castle entrance - He has a quest for those seeking faster travel around the swamp and it's "barriers"
-New ring introduced for level 150+ requiring 211 strength to use it (craft @tina: Ring base + ring of protection + ring of desecration + *uncut onyx  *new item from different Ratkin mobs) the ring provides both max damage and damage reduction and is incredibly powerful

July - 4th 2024

June - 18th 2024
-added an upgraded nightmare dagger. It is player crafted with a potion of darkness(crafted with blackscale skin or nightmare fuel + Fresh Water) + a shadow gem (sold by dregnel). This will give you a potion of shadows. The potion of shadows can be combined with the nightmare dagger to make the new upgraded dagger lvl 130 required
-Added Emerald Bow of Destiny it is a lvl 130 bow that is slower in speed but higher in damage  which should help with arrow shortage issues - it is created with an emerald brew (emerald bought from drengel + fresh water) + Long bow of destiny (from ranger's guild)

Black Reaper + Updater + more releases

-Black Reaper class overhaul/update:
-energy drain(yellow-necromancer class) is no longer a pvp skill and instead decreases opponents accuracy
-Void Light - new spell - casts a curse on a single enemy inflicting damage *new fx with this spell
-Shatter Ethereal - new spell - casts powerful magic spikes at a single enemy *new FX
-Black Magic Barrage - new spell - casts lower powered fast paced orbs - for all necromancers - bought in faith at mezmear
-Reaper Fumes - new spell - casts damage over time on a single enemy, very powerful but slow cast speed *new FX
-Shadow Rain 2 + Poison Rain 2 + Meteor I + Icefield 1 + 2- existing spells - no longer available to black reaper or necromancers
-Ghoul touch - existing spell - slight buff
-Death orb - Existing spell - now only exists for black reaper, removed from lich - slight tweaks to the spell - max gems more powerful
-Guild house created for black reaper, just north of Hope between the 2 paths that lead north
-unique quest line to get access to trade within guild

With the above updates keep in mind it is no longer advised to go with a red or blue or green necromancer if you wish to use AOE spells
you will now have to choose wisely as each color of necromancer will have different capabilities and uses to your party and experience playing.
Below is a small guide based off of colors that should assist you in choosing the right color for your needs:

Red: necromancer has the unique spell blood leaches. which is a damage over time spell. it does not have an aoe spell

Blue: necromancer has nullify defenses a very powerful spell that kills opponents DR. it does not have an aoe spell

White necromancer has sys relief one of the most powerful spells to a wizards arsenal since it regens MP. Necro has shadow rain 1. lich has shadow rain 2

Yellow: necromancer has energy drain a spell that vastly nullifies opponents attack rating + necromancer gets poison rain 1. Lich gets poison rain 2.

Green: necromancer is a waste at this time. So please do not play green unless you want to receive absolutely no benefits listed above and handicap yourself. No judgement if you are into that thing though. lol

Additional updates:
-more spawns on shadow island
-increase quest xp from king barias on shadow island(probably the current meta for xp farming especially with a team)
-decreased resistances to most color for most monsters on shadow island to make it more balanced for mages + spell usage
-with the above update comes a slight nerf to timestop + entangle + tangled Web only the duration is going to be changed (otherwise too op)
-Drengel in the town of Grace now has 2 new quests that encourage exploration of Shadow Islands surface
-Quest rewards from both of the above quests include 2 new skills that anyone can use* *internal magic is lvl 130 min to use
