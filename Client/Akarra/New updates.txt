Black Reaper + Updater + more releases

UPDATER: The game now has an auto updater. This will automatically check that your game is up to date by checking the current_version folder for the right number and downloading automatically based off of if you are up to date. All that this will do is update your sectors and gfx folders, as well as give you the new version number + new updates text files. This will now make it less hassle to know if you are running the correct version and having to go find the download for it.


REAPER + NECRO TWEAKS:

-Black Reaper class overhaul/update
-Void Light - new spell - casts a curse on a single enemy inflicting damage *new fx with this spell
-Shatter Ethereal - new spell - casts powerful magic spikes at a single enemy *new FX
-Reaper Fumes - new spell - casts damage over time on a single enemy, very powerful but slow cast speed *new FX
-Shadow Rain 2 + Poison Rain 2 + Meteor I + Icefield 1 + 2- existing spells - no longer available to black reaper or necromancers
-Ghoul touch - existing spell - slight buff
-Death orb - Existing spell - now only exists for black reaper, removed from lich - slight tweaks to the spell - max gems more powerful
-Guild house created for black reaper, just north of Hope between the 2 paths that lead north
-unique quest line to get access to trade within guild

-Energy drain(yellow-necromancer class) is no longer a pvp skill and instead decreases opponents accuracy
-Dark Magic Barrage - new spell - casts lower powered fast paced orbs - for all necromancers - bought in faith at mezmear or black reaper guild

With the above updates keep in mind it is no longer advised to go with a red or blue or green necromancer if you wish to use AOE spells
you will now have to choose wisely as each color of necromancer will have different capabilities and uses to your party and experience playing.
Below is a small guide based off of colors that should assist you in choosing the right color for your needs:

Red: necromancer has the unique spell blood leaches. which is a damage over time spell. it does not have an aoe spell

Blue: necromancer has nullify defenses a very powerful spell that kills opponents DR. it does not have an aoe spell

White necromancer has sys relief one of the most powerful spells to a wizards arsenal since it regens MP.Necro has shadow rain 1. lich has shadow rain 2

Yellow: necromancer has energy drain a spell that vastly nullifies opponents attack rating + necromancer gets poison rain 1. Lich gets poison rain 2.

Green: necromancer is a waste at this time. So please do not play green unless you want to receieve absolutley no benefits listed above and handicap yourself. No judgement if you are into that thing though. lol

Additional updates:
-more spawns on shadow island
-increase quest xp from king barias on shadow island(probably the current meta for xp farming especially with a team)
-decreased resistances to most color for most monsters on shadow island to make it more balanced for mages + spell usage
-with the above update comes a slight nerf to timestop + entangle + tangled Web only the duration is going to be changed (otherwise too op)
-Drengel in the town of Grace now has 2 new quests that encourage exploration of Shadow Islands surface
-Quest rewards from both of the above quests include 2 new skills that anyone can use* *internal magic is lvl 130 min to use

-2 new spells from drengels quests:
-Internal Light - gives a light boost to those without a light or those wanting more
-Internal Magic - gives a cr boost for any class that is above lvl 130
